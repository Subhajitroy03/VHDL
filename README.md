## ⚡ What is VHDL?

**VHDL** (VHSIC Hardware Description Language) is used to describe, simulate, and implement digital hardware systems. It supports multiple abstraction levels including behavioral, dataflow, and structural modeling.

## ✅ Why VHDL?

- 🔁 Reusable, modular design  
- 💡 Behavioral + structural modeling  
- 🧠 Concurrent execution  
- ⚙️ Real-time simulation & testing  
- 📦 Platform-independent (FPGA/ASIC ready)
